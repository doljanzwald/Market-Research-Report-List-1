<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Flat Panel Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPD</li><li>Direct Conversion FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital flat panel detectors (FPDs) market consists of two main types: indirect conversion FPDs and direct conversion FPDs. Indirect conversion FPDs use a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into visible light, which is then detected by a photodetector. In contrast, direct conversion FPDs convert X-rays directly into an electrical signal, resulting in improved image quality and faster processing times. The choice between these technologies depends on specific imaging needs and applications within radiology and other medical fields.</p></p>
