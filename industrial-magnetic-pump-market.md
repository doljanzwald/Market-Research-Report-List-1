<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial magnetic pump market is categorized into two main types: stationary shaft and rotating shaft pumps. Stationary shaft magnetic pumps feature a fixed motor that drives the impeller through magnetic coupling, minimizing contact and wear, making them ideal for hazardous or corrosive fluids. Conversely, rotating shaft magnetic pumps have a shaft connected directly to the impeller, allowing for a more straightforward design but may require more maintenance. Both types are used in applications requiring efficient, leak-free fluid transfer.</p></p>
