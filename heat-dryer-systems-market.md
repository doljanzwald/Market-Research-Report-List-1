<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Dryer Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Type</li><li>Indirect Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat dryer systems can be classified into two main types: direct and indirect. Direct heat dryers transfer hot air or gases directly to the material being dried, allowing for rapid drying but also risking temperature-sensitive materials. Indirect heat dryers, on the other hand, use heated surfaces or conduits to transfer heat, providing a gentler drying process that reduces contamination risk and preserves material integrity. Each type serves different industries and applications based on drying efficiency and material requirements.</p></p>
