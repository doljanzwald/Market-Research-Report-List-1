<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underfloor Heating for Residential Buildings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydronic Heating</li><li>Electric Heating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Underfloor heating for residential buildings primarily includes two market types: hydronic heating and electric heating. Hydronic heating utilizes water pipes installed beneath the floor, circulating heated water from a boiler or heat pump, providing even warmth. In contrast, electric heating employs electric cables or mats under the flooring, using electrical resistance to generate heat. Both systems promote energy efficiency and comfort, but hydronic systems often offer lower running costs for larger areas, whereas electric systems allow for easier installation and zoning.</p></p>
