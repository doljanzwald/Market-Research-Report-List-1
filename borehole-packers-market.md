<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Borehole Packers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Inflatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Borehole Packers market comprises two primary types: mechanical and inflatable. Mechanical packers utilize steel and rubber components to create a seal within the borehole, allowing for better control during geological assessments or water flow tests. They are durable and suitable for high-pressure environments. Inflatable packers, on the other hand, use air or fluid to expand a rubber bladder against the borehole wall, providing a flexible seal. They are versatile and ideal for varying borehole conditions, making both types essential for effective borehole management.</p></p>
